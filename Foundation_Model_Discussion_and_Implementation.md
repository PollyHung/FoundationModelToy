## Original Concept: Three-Layer AI Framework

### Initial Vision
1. **Foundation Model**: Pre-trained on multi-omics bulk data
2. **Digital Twin**: Patient-specific computational models  
3. **Virtual Cell**: Single-cell resolution drug response modeling

### Challenges Identified
- **Scope too broad**: Mixing three complex technologies in one framework
- **Resource intensive**: Would require massive computational resources
- **Timeline unrealistic**: 36+ months for proof of concept
- **Technical complexity**: Unclear integration between layers

## Refined Approach: Sequence-Enhanced Foundation Model

### Core Innovation
**Hybrid Architecture**: Combine processed molecular data (gene counts, CNV) with raw sequence information from key genomic regions

### Why This Approach?
1. **Builds on existing strengths**: Leverages processed RNA/DNA data
2. **Manageable scope**: Focused on clinically relevant sequences
3. **Novel contribution**: Sequence-enhanced multi-modal learning
4. **Computationally feasible**: ~10x less compute than full nucleotide transformer
5. **Clinically interpretable**: Direct path to clinical applications
